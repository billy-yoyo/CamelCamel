# Problems

* Tom can't do anything (possibly to do with failing to join game? possible space in name? could end turn, couldn't use any actions.)
* add tutorial / help instructions.

# Resolved

* You can move onto your own tile
* brown & red too similar
* rejoining game doesn't work
* sanitize player name & game name
* add undo
